# Deep-Sensor-Fusion

This Project aims to use deep learning for early fusion of sensor(Camera, LiDAR) information to perform 3D bounding box
estimation and object identification for autonomus driving. Object detection is the challenging problem espically in Autonomus 
driving, therefore we need a robust persistive system to identify objects in unpredictable environments like raining, night fall, etc.

The main objective is to combine LiDAR point cloud data and corresponding camera image by a fusion network in order to perform
3D object detection. The model is evaluated on KITTI 3D object detection bench suite.
